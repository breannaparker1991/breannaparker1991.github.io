          <p>I earned my bachelor's degree in premed and decided to work in the lab. I have over five years of lab work, running calibrations, fixing machines, running patient samples, using critical thinking on odd results, and working with nurses and doctors on a patient results. I've currently finished my master's in data science. I love working with numbers and coding and would love to work in an industry where I can continue to grow and push myself to learn new things.</p>
