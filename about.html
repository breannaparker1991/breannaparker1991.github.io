          <p>I earned my bachelor's degree in Biology and decided to work in the lab. So, I went back to get my Associate's in Medical Laboratory Sciences. I have over five years of lab experience, running calibrations, fixing machines, running patient samples, using critical thinking on odd results, and working with nurses and doctors on a patient results. I realized that my skill set would work great in tech so I went to a bootcamp to learn how to code websites. After this I finished my Master's in Data Science. I love working with numbers and coding and would love to work in an industry where I can continue to grow and push myself to learn new things.</p>
